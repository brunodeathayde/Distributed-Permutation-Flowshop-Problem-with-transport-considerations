### 🔍 Abstract
This study addresses the flow shop scheduling problem with transport times between machines. It proposes exact methods to minimize makespan and tardiness while accounting for inter-machine transport delays. The paper introduces a mathematical model and evaluates its performance across various instance sizes.

### 🧪 Key Contributions
- Formulation of a flow shop scheduling model with transport times
- Integration of release dates and due dates into the scheduling logic
- Comparative analysis of exact methods on benchmark instances
- Performance metrics: makespan, total tardiness, and computational time
