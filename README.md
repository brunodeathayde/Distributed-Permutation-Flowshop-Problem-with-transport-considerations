# üöö Distributed Permutation Flowshop Scheduling with Transport Considerations

This repository presents the research and implementation related to the Distributed Permutation Flowshop Problem (DPFSP) with transport times. It includes mathematical and constraint programming models, benchmark test instances, experimental results, and the conference article submitted to CIE52.

## üß† Problem Overview

The Distributed Permutation Flowshop Problem (DPFSP) extends the classical flowshop scheduling problem by distributing machines across multiple locations and introducing transport times between them. The objective is to optimize job sequencing across distributed machines while minimizing metrics such as makespan and total tardiness.
